___

This is my personal configuration for the **i3 Window Manager**, The setup combines key lightweight Linux tools to create a fully featured tiling window environment, including:

- [Dunst](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst) – for notifications
- [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) – for launching applications and switching windows
- [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) – for a modular status bar
- [Picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom) – for transparency, shadows, and fading effects

## Requirements

Before using this setup, ensure you have the following software installed:

### Core Components

- `i3` or `i3-gaps` – the window manager
- `rofi` – application launcher and dmenu replacement
