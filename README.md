This is my personal configuration for the **i3 Window Manager**, The setup combines key lightweight Linux tools to create a fully featured tiling window environment, including:

- 🔔 [Dunst](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst) – for notifications
- 🔍 [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) – for launching applications and switching windows
- 📊 [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) – for a modular status bar
- 💨 [Picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom) – for transparency, shadows, and fading effects
